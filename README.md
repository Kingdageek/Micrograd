### Micrograd

Micrograd is a simple autograd engine, this was built to get a better intuition of Neural Networks following [Andrej Karpathy's Youtube lecture](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0)

I added `relu` and `sigmoid` functions, their `backward` expressions and added options on the Multilayer Perceptron Class to enable the specifying of different activation functions for the hidden and output layers. There's also like a lot of helpful comments detailing the purpose of every code blocks, admittedly, this was to help me internalize some concepts.

To get Graphviz to display, besides the `graphviz` library, you might need to install the Graphviz executable found [here](https://graphviz.org/download/) on your computer
